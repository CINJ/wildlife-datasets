# Recommended datasets 

The package handles a large number of datasets. Even though it is possible to test developed methods on all these datasets, some combinations name more sense. We export several possible combinations. Before testing methods, the datasets need to be downloaded first. The following script considers the two sea turtle datasets and checks whether the datasets are downloaded. If not, they will be downloaded.

```python
from wildlife_datasets import datasets

names_to_check = [datasets.SeaTurtleIDHeads, datasets.ZindiTurtleRecall]
for name in names_to_check:
    try:
        name(f'data/{name.__name__}')
    except:
        name.get_data('data')
```


## Wild datasets


## Small datasets


## Transfer learning

The package handles multiple different datasets of the same or similar animal species. Then it is natural to train a method on one dataset and evaluate the performance on another dataset. 


### Sea turtles

There are two sea turtle datasets. While SeaTurtleIDHeads (or its uncropped version SeaTurtleID) contains loggerhead turtles, ZindiTurtleRecall shows green turtles.

```python exec="true" source="above" result="console" name="run"
datasets.transfer_turtles

print_list_red(datasets.transfer_turtles) # markdown-exec: hide
```

### Cows

Multiple dataset show the Friesian cows. While all these datasets were captured at one place, they show the cows in different settings.

```python exec="true" source="above" result="console" name="run"
datasets.transfer_cows

print_list_red(datasets.transfer_cows) # markdown-exec: hide
```

### Giraffes

There are five datasets with zebras. GiraffeZebraID contains both giraffes and zebras, StripeSpotter is the oldest public wildlife dataset and WNIGiraffes is a dataset of huge giraffe images. The other two datasets pose certain issues, namely, Giraffes is automatically labelled by Hotspotter (there is no guarantee of the label correctness), SMALST does not depict real animals but generated images from 3D models (based on real animals). 

```python exec="true" source="above" result="console" name="run"
datasets.transfer_giraffes

print_list_red(datasets.transfer_giraffes) # markdown-exec: hide
```

### Primates

The datasets CTai, CZoo and MacaqueFaces are very similar, all containing a relatively low resolution head images of chimpanzees (CTai and CZoo) or macaques (MacaqueFaces).

```python exec="true" source="above" result="console" name="run"
datasets.transfer_primates

print_list_red(datasets.transfer_primates) # markdown-exec: hide
```

### Whales, dolphins and sharks

We group these three relatively distant mammals into one group because they can all be recognize by their fin shape. The group for transfer learning will be probably the most difficult because it contains various animals takes from various poses. BelugaID is a dataset of beluga whales taken from the top, while HumpbackWhaleID contain images of the tail fin of humpback whales. HappyWhale combines both these poses. NOAARightWhale is a dataset of right whales taken from a relatively large distance. The last two datasets do not depict whales. While NDD20 is a dataset of dolphins, WhaleSharkID is a dataset of whale sharks.

```python exec="true" source="above" result="console" name="run"
datasets.transfer_whales

print_list_red(datasets.transfer_whales) # markdown-exec: hide
```

## Segmentated datasets

## Problematic datasets

There are a few datasets which we recommend not to use. AAUZebraFish is more of a tracking dataset. Drosophila contains a huge number of fly images extracted from videos. LionData contain only a few images of each lion; moreover, most of the images contain only a small part of the lion (such as an ear).
